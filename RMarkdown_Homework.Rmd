Hi, there :d I am a senior student studying Industrial Engineering at Boğaziçi University. I am very interested in machine learning and deep learning topics so that I completed courses like Data Mining and Graph Theory. I did multiple internships on data science fields like machine learning and optimization. I am going to be full time Data Scientist or ML Engineer.

## Statistical Models for Sport in R

This is of course about constructing statistical predictive models in sports area. In this field the well known, popular tasks are about to predict future winners. I found this interesting because in statistics course (IE256-Baydogan) one of our homework assignment was about football betting. We only used multiple linear regression to predict the winner since it was an introductory course. 

By the way, did you know that the Pythagorean theorem is quite powerful to predict win expectations? I didn't know too. It is actually great to prove that complex models aren't always better, solving the problem easily as much as possible is much better.
